Dear Ameriflux community,

Data vanish over time. Syntheses are laborious and usually one-shot efforts. Soil surface carbon fluxes ("soil respiration") are increasingly measured with continuous, automated analyzers, generating large volumes of data that have nowhere to go.

I've recently been working with some colleagues on COSORE, a reproducibility-oriented open database for continuous soil respiration data, intended as a community resource for synthesis and reference. It's "reproducibility-oriented" because contributed raw data are built, via a software pipeline, into a standardized final product; and "open" because it's entirely free for use, although citations of and co-authorship with data contributors are highly encouraged. Links for more information:
* Current database (v0.1) summary: http://rpubs.com/bpbond/505706
* Tweets about this effort: https://twitter.com/BenBondLamberty/status/1137799320147771397 and https://twitter.com/eosense/status/1138834593883328512

**This email is a call for data contributions.** There are currently 24 contributed datasets in COSORE, already a million flux observations over the last twenty years, and we're looking to expand this.

**Contributing your data is straightforward.** We ask you to (i) fill out a metadata form (link below); (ii) upload your data; and (iii) help us QC the data after integration. All v1.0 contributors will be included on a database definition paper, currently planned for fall 2019.

**Interested?** Start by filling out and submitting the metadata form: $GOOGLE_FORM_LINK

Feedback on the metadata form, database design and goals, etc., is welcome.

Finally, what about Ameriflux BADM? I've had a number of discussions with the Ameriflux team, and they support this effort, seeing it as complementary with their planned soil respiration component of BADM (the timeline for which remains uncertain as far as I know).

Thanks and kind regards,
 
Ben Bond-Lamberty
