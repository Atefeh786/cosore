#		Savannas, Grassland, Wetland, Cropland, Urban
#	CSR_NETWORK and CSR_SITE_ID: Optional network (e.g. "Ameriflux") and site ID in network
# 	CSR_INSTRUMENT: e.g. "LI-8100A/LI-8150" for standard Licor setup,
#		"LI-8100A" (no multiplexer), others...
# 	Primary publication: optional DOI (preferred) or other primary publication 
#		that should be cited when these data are used. Leave empty if unpublished.
