# DESCRIPTION.txt
#
# This key-value data file holds the minimal metadata for each dataset.
# Most entries  be filled out for each dataset. Entries below include:
# 	CSR_SITE_NAME: standard site name
# 	CSR_LONGITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = east, negative = west
# 	CSR_LATITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = north, negative = south
# 	CSR_ELEVATION: elevation above sea level, meters
#	CSR_TIMEZONE: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
#		For US sites, a corresponding Central American timezone is used if
#		the instrument does not follow daylight savings
# 	CSR_IGBP: CSR_IGBP land cover type. Common types include:
#		Evergreen needleleaf forest, Evergreen broadleaf forest,
#		Deciduous needleleaf forest, Deciduous broadleaf forest,
#		Mixed forests, Closed shrubland, Open shrubland, Woody savanna,
#		Savannas, Grassland, Wetland, Cropland, Urban
#	CSR_NETWORK and CSR_SITE_ID: Optional network (e.g. "Ameriflux") and site ID in network
# 	CSR_INSTRUMENT: e.g. "LI-8100A/LI-8150" for standard Licor setup,
#		"LI-8100A" (no multiplexer), others...
#	CSR_MSMT_LENGTH: measurement length (seconds)
#	CSR_FILE_FORMAT: "Processed", "Processed_csv", "Custom", "LI-8100A_raw", etc.
#	CSR_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT. See ?strptime, but briefly:
		%d day of month; %H hour; %M minute; %m month; %S second; %Y year; %y year w/o century
# 	Primary publication: optional DOI (preferred) or other primary publication
#		that should be cited when these data are used. Leave empty if unpublished.
# 	Other publications: optional comma-separated DOIs
# 	CSR_ACKNOWLEDGMENT: optional acknowledgment (funding or other) text

CSR_ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Financial Support was provided by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological & Environmental Research, under Award Number DE-SC0012003. Logistical support and/or data were provided by the NSF-supported Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory. This research was conducted in Penn State's Stone Valley Forest, which is funded by the Penn State College of Agriculture Sciences, Department of Ecosystem Science and Management and managed by the staff of the Forestlands Management Office.
CSR_NOTES: Spikes in soil respiration were detected and removed. We computed the mean and standard deviation for a series of moving windows of length L (here L=24, equals two days data). The window moves one data point at a time through the series. Any data in the window that exceeds 3.5 standard deviation is considered as a spike and replaced with NaN. (The raw data are included in COSORE.)
