CSR_NOTE: These data are from a whole-ecosystem warming experiment. Each collar was in a sunlit, climate controlled chamber that was either held at ambient temperature, warmed symetrically (+3.5 degrees day and night) or warmed asymetrically (+5C at dawn, decreasing to +2C at mid-afternoon). There are 12 collars representing 4 replicates per treatment.
