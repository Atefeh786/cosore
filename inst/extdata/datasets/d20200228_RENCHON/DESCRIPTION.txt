# DESCRIPTION.txt
#
# This key-value data file holds the minimal metadata for each dataset.
# Most entries  be filled out for each dataset. Entries below include:
# 	CSR_SITE_NAME: standard site name
# 	CSR_LONGITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = east, negative = west
# 	CSR_LATITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = north, negative = south
# 	CSR_ELEVATION: elevation above sea level, meters
#	CSR_TIMEZONE: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
#		For US sites, a corresponding Central American timezone is used if 
#		the instrument does not follow daylight savings 
# 	CSR_IGBP: CSR_IGBP land cover type. Common types include:
#		Evergreen needleleaf forest, Evergreen broadleaf forest,
#		Deciduous needleleaf forest, Deciduous broadleaf forest,
#		Mixed forests, Closed shrubland, Open shrubland, Woody savanna,
#		Savannas, Grassland, Wetland, Cropland, Urban
#	CSR_NETWORK and CSR_SITE_ID: Optional network (e.g. "Ameriflux") and site ID in network
# 	CSR_INSTRUMENT: e.g. "LI-8100A/LI-8150" for standard Licor setup,
#		"LI-8100A" (no multiplexer), others...
#	CSR_MSMT_LENGTH: measurement length (seconds)
#	CSR_FILE_FORMAT: "Processed", "Processed_csv", "Custom", "LI-8100A_raw", etc.
#	CSR_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT. See ?strptime, but briefly:
		%d day of month; %H hour; %M minute; %m month; %S second; %Y year; %y year w/o century
# 	Primary publication: optional DOI (preferred) or other primary publication 
#		that should be cited when these data are used. Leave empty if unpublished.
# 	Other publications: optional comma-separated DOIs
# 	CSR_ACKNOWLEDGMENT: optional acknowledgment (funding or other) text

CSR_ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The first 2 years of soil respiration data (2014 and 2015) were previously published (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0457-7). Data were collected at the Cumberland Plain Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) site, which encompasses EucFACE and the flux tower. The Cumberland Plain TERN facilities are supported by the Australian Government through the Education Investment Fund, the Department of Industry and Science, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, and the Australian Research Council in partnership with Western Sydney University. Facilities at EucFACE were built as an initiative of the Australian Government as part of the Nation-building Economic Stimulus Package.
CSR_NOTE: A manuscript using this dataset will be submitted within the next few month. Temporary title: "Simultaneous measurements of soil and ecosystem respiration: advantages, lessons, and questions"
