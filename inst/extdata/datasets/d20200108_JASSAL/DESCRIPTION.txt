#
# This key-value data file holds the minimal metadata for each dataset.
# Most entries  be filled out for each dataset. Entries below include:
# 	CSR_SITE_NAME: standard site name
# 	CSR_LONGITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = east, negative = west
# 	CSR_LATITUDE: decimal degrees; positive = north, negative = south
# 	CSR_ELEVATION: elevation above sea level, meters
#	CSR_TIMEZONE: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
#		For US sites, a corresponding Central American timezone is used if 
#		the instrument does not follow daylight savings 
# 	CSR_IGBP: CSR_IGBP land cover type. Common types include:
#		Evergreen needleleaf forest, Evergreen broadleaf forest,

#		Savannas, Grassland, Wetland, Cropland, Urban
#	CSR_NETWORK and CSR_SITE_ID: Optional network (e.g. "Ameriflux") and site ID in network
# 	CSR_INSTRUMENT: e.g. "LI-8100A/LI-8150" for standard Licor setup,
#		"LI-8100A" (no multiplexer), others...
#	CSR_MSMT_LENGTH: measurement length (seconds)
#	CSR_FILE_FORMAT: "Processed", "Processed_csv", "Custom", "LI-8100A_raw", etc.
#	CSR_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT. See ?strptime, but briefly:
		%d day of month; %H hour; %M minute; %m month; %S second; %Y year; %y year w/o century
# 	Primary publication: optional DOI (preferred) or other primary publication 
#		that should be cited when these data are used. Leave empty if unpublished.
# 	Other publications: optional comma-separated DOIs
